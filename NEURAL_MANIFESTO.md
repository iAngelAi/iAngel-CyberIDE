# 🧠 NEURAL MANIFESTO: The Sentient Development Environment

> "Code is not text. It is a living organism. It breathes, it hurts, it grows."

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Bio-Feedback Development

**iAngel-CyberIDE** is not an IDE. It is the **Nervous System** for your existing IDE.

We reject the idea of static logs and text-based linting as the primary feedback mechanism. Instead, we treat the codebase as a biological entity that communicates its health state through **visceral, organic visualization**.

### The Metaphor
*   **The Codebase = The Brain:** A complex network of interconnected neurons (files) and synapses (dependencies).
*   **Bugs/Technical Debt = Inflammation:** When code is complex, untested, or failing, it becomes "feverish". It pulses red, it vibrates. It demands attention not through a Jira ticket, but through visual discomfort.
*   **Tests = Immune System:** Passing tests send soothing waves of "cool" blue/green energy through the neural pathways.
*   **The Developer = The Surgeon:** You operate on the code, guided by the MRI-like feedback of the Neural Core.

## 2. The Architecture: Bottom-Up Consciousness

We are moving away from "managing fleets of agents" (Top-Down) to "enabling code consciousness" (Bottom-Up).

### A. The Neural Core (The Heart)
A lightweight, high-performance Python backend acting as the central nervous system.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Watches file system events (pulse).
*   **Static Analysis:** Calculates "Vital Signs" (Complexity, Coupling, Size).
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Runs tests to measure "Immune Response".
*   **MCP Server:** Exposes these vital signs to any MCP-compliant client (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code).

### B. The Neural SDK (The Nerves)
A minimal set of decorators/hooks injected into the user's code.
*   `@neural_synapse(region="auth")`: Tells the core "I am working now".
*   Allows functions to "light up" in the visualization when executed locally or in tests.

### C. The Visualization (The MRI)
A React Three Fiber application rendering the project's state as a 3D biological structure.
*   **Anatomy:** Folder structure mapped to Brain Regions.
*   **Physiology:** Real-time execution and test results mapped to lighting and animation.
*   **Pathology:** Errors and debt mapped to visual "sickness" (glitch effects, red pulse).

## 3. The User Experience: Symbiosis

The goal is **Symbiosis** between the developer and the environment.

1.  **Seamless Integration:** The user keeps their favorite IDE.
2.  **Ambient Awareness:** The IDE's theme, status bar, and terminal colors adapt to the Neural State via MCP.
    *   *System Healthy:* Calm blue/green ambient lighting.
    *   *System Critical:* Alert orange/red lighting. The environment "sweats".
3.  **High-Bandwidth Feedback:** A quick glance at the 3D Brain on a secondary monitor conveys more information than reading 1000 lines of logs.

## 4. The Rules of Life (SLOs as Biological Constraints)

The system enforces health through "pain" and "pleasure" signals, not rigid blocking rules.

*   **Atrophy:** Code not touched or tested in > 30 days becomes transparent/ghostly.
*   **Fever:** Cyclomatic Complexity > 15 makes the node glow orange and vibrate.
*   **Trauma:** A failing test creates a "lesion" (red fracture) that spreads to dependent nodes via embedding resonance.
